# NAO Red Ball Tracker

This is a simple red ball tracker for the NAO robot. It uses the NAOqi API to connect and control the robot.

The robot searches for the ball and for a goal (marked by a Landmark) and then moves into a collinear position with the ball and the goal. It then walks towards the ball and kicks the ball towards the goal.
